# Anti Distraction Python Script

This script is made to check ever second if I am watching youtube reels or I am in face book if I am it will click on some buttons and stop me from doing those without my permission (which is good)

First clone it go to that directory then create a virtual env and then go inside that env then run this command

` pip install -r requirements.tx`

Run this command to compile it

`pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=opencv-python main.py`

you will get an executable file in dist folder just run it and thats it
