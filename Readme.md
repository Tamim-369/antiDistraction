# Anti Distraction Python Script

This script is made to check ever second if I am watching youtube reels or I am in face book if I am it will click on some buttons and stop me from doing those without my permission (which is good)

First go to the images folder then take screenshots from your pc like those image and rename those as the same name as I used

Second clone it go to that directory then create a virtual env and then go inside that env then run this command

` pip install -r requirements.tx`

Run this command to compile it and after it runs copy images folder inside dist folder

`pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=opencv-python main.py`

you will get an executable file in dist folder just run it and thats it
